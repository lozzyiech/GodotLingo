# GodotLingo

🌍 A Quality-of-Life web platform designed to simplify game localization for **Godot Engine** developers.

GodotLingo is a lightweight, user-friendly tool that helps indie developers and small teams manage text translations across multiple languages — right from the browser. Whether you're building a narrative-driven RPG or a simple puzzle game, GodotLingo makes it easier to translate, organize, and export your game’s strings without leaving your workflow.

## 🎯 Why GodotLingo?

Localization in Godot often involves manually editing `.csv` files — a process that can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to collaborate on. GodotLingo streamlines this by offering:

- A clean, intuitive web interface for managing translations.
- Support for Godot’s native localization formats.
- Smart suggestions using optional AI or machine translation (e.g. DeepL, Google Translate).
- Fast export/import to sync with your Godot project.
- Future support for team collaboration and versioning.

No more switching between text editors, spreadsheets, and the engine. Just upload, translate, and download — all in one place.

## 💡 Features (Coming Soon)

- Upload and parse `.csv` localization files.
- Edit translations in a tabular, spreadsheet-like UI.
- View context (e.g. message IDs) to avoid ambiguous translations.
- Export localized files ready for Godot.
- Optional integration with translation APIs (opt-in, privacy-first).
- Planned: Godot Editor plugin for direct sync.

## 🌱 Open & Community-Driven

GodotLingo is built for the Godot community, by the Godot community. The project is open-source and welcomes contributions in:
- Frontend & backend development
- UX/UI design
- Localization testing
- Documentation & tutorials
