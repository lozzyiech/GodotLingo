# GodotLingo

🌍 A Quality-of-Life web platform designed to simplify game localization for **Godot Engine** developers.

GodotLingo is a lightweight, user-friendly tool that helps indie developers and small teams manage text translations across multiple languages — right from the browser. Whether you're building a narrative-driven RPG or a simple puzzle game, GodotLingo makes it easier to translate, organize, and export your game’s strings without leaving your workflow.

## 🎯 Why GodotLingo?

Localization in Godot often involves manually editing `.csv` files — a process that can be time-consuming, error-prone, and hard to collaborate on. GodotLingo streamlines this by offering:

- A clean, intuitive web interface for managing translations.
- Support for Godot’s native localization formats.


## 💡 Features (Coming Soon)

- Upload and parse `.csv` localization files.
- Edit translations in a tabular, spreadsheet-like UI.
- Export localized files ready for Godot.
